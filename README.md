# SMART: A New Patient Similarity Estimation Framework for Enhanced Predictive Modeling in Acute Kidney Injury
Measuring patient similarity is crucial for precision medicine, facilitating predictive modeling, disease subtyping, and personalized treatments by stratifying patients into clinically meaningful subgroups based on high-dimensional data. This study aims to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based patient similarity estimation framework to enhance predictive modeling.  

The proposed framework, SMART (Similarity Measurement and Analysis for Risk Tracking), introduces three key enhancements: (1) adjusting patient similarity by overlap rate weighting (OW); (2) distance measure optimization (DO); and (3) feature type weight optimization (FO). These enhancements were evaluated across varying cohort sizes through internal and external validations using data from two tertiary academic hospitals to predict acute kidney injury (AKI).
